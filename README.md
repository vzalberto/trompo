```
npm run build && rm -rf deploy/public/* && mv -rf build/* deploy/public/
```

That command will do 3 things, chained together with the `&&` operator:

1. Create an optimized production build of the front end code. `npm run build`
2. Delete the contents of the public folder inside the Firebase app. `rm -rf deploy/public/*`
3. Move the freshly created react build into the Firebase project `mv -rf build/* deploy/public/`

In a way, it is like preparing a log for your fireplace ðŸ”¥.

Or, as we say in spanish:

```
alias leÃ±a='npm run build && rm -rf deploy/public/* && cp -rf build/* deploy/public/' 
```
